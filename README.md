# remove_mcmc_output

Remove all those files generated by phylogenetic MCMC software

## Description

Running a MCMC program (e.g., MrBayes, BEAST, PhyloBayes) often 
generates a large number of files. If you wish to repeat your
analyses in the same working directory, you either need to
make sure files are overwritten, named something else, or simply
remove them before the next run.

The provided scripts (`rmbayes`, `rmbeast`, `rmphylobayes`)
attempts to remove all those files generated by the software,
while keeping the original data. Please make sure to look at
the list of files to be removed before deleting them!

### Example: Removing all output from a MrBayes run

    $ rmbayes
    
    Checking for MrBayes output using ls:

    ls: cannot access '*.p~': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.t~': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.con': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.sumt': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.sump': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.stat': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.mcmc~': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access 'hmean.txt': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.chp': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.log': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access 'log.*': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access 'out.*': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access 'temp.comp.dists': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.ss': No such file or directory
    ls: cannot access '*.mstat': No such file or directory

    Found the following output from MrBayes

    data.nex.ckp
    data.nex.ckp~
    data.nex.con.tre
    data.nex.lstat
    data.nex.mcmc
    data.nex.parts
    data.nex.pstat
    data.nex.run1.p
    data.nex.run1.t
    data.nex.run2.p
    data.nex.run2.t
    data.nex.trprobs
    data.nex.tstat
    data.nex.vstat

    Do you want to delete these files [y/n]? y

`rmbayes -f` or say `yes | rmbayes`.
